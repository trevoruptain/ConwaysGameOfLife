# Conway’s Game of Life
This is a simple, console-based version of Conway's Game of Life written in Ruby. The board is randomly seeded on initialization.

To play, simply run `game.rb` in your terminal. The program will prompt you for a grid size and a seed value. A lower value correlates to a larger distribution of ‘live’ squares.

I find the most interesting results at a grid size of about 60 x 60 and a seed value of around 10.
